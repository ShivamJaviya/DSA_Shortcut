# DSA with C++ - Organized and Easy to Understand

Welcome to the **DSA with C++** repository! This collection of C++ files is designed to help you understand Data Structures and Algorithms in a structured, organized, and easy-to-follow manner.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders, each representing a different topic or type of algorithm. The files within these folders are named and organized to reflect a smooth flow of understanding, from basic concepts to more complex implementations.

### Folders :

- **Basics**: Introductory concepts and fundamental algorithms.
- **Sorting**: Implementations of various sorting algorithms.
- **Searching**: Different searching techniques and their use cases.
- **Data Structures**: Implementation of various data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions to problems using dynamic programming approaches.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms following the greedy method.
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, and other graph-related algorithms.

## üìö Guidance and References

This repository is guided by **Shivam Javiya** and references the well-known DSA resources:

- **Love Babbar**'s DSA Sheet
- **Striver**'s DSA Content

These references have been instrumental in shaping the structure and content of this repository.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
